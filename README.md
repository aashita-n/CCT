# CloudCompare: A Multi-Cloud Comparison Tool

CloudCompare is a responsive and user-friendly web application that allows seamless comparison of compute and storage services from major cloud providers â€” AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Built using Python (Flask), HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, the platform simplifies cloud service decision-making with a clean UI and powerful filtering capabilities.

## Problem Statement

With the vast offerings from AWS, Azure, and GCP, choosing the right compute or storage service can be confusing due to:

- Inconsistent terminologies
- Varied pricing models
- Scattered documentation

CloudCompare solves this by presenting all relevant service information in a centralized, standardized, and filterable format.

---

## Objectives

- Build a user-friendly web application to compare cloud services.
- Provide standardized and comprehensive information across AWS, Azure, and GCP.
- Implement dynamic filters based on vCPU, memory, price, and region.
- Gain hands-on experience in full-stack development and deployment.
- Simulate realistic cloud service decisions using structured data.
- Deploy on a cloud-native platform (Render) to showcase hosting skills.
- Keep the design modular to allow future API integrations.

## Features

- Real-time filtering of services by vCPU, memory, price, and region
- Side-by-side comparison across AWS, Azure, and GCP
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile screens
- Built using Flask (backend) and HTML/CSS/JS (frontend)
- Hosted live on Render
